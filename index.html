Adam Pantanowitz is an electrical and biomedical engineer, entrepreneur, scientist, motivational speaker, academic, philanthropist and artificial intelligence expert.<br> <br>
You can find him working in a coffee shop, lecturing medicine or engineering, hosting a meeting, developing a new app or software, founding a company, presenting at a conference or giving a motivational talk. His areas of expertise include artificial intelligence, ethics, biotechnology, engineering and robotics. With 10 years of experience, Adam has used his skills as a technologist to disrupt and innovate within the biomedical sphere. <br><br>

									He is also a Chartered Engineer <a href="https://www.engc.org.uk/" target="_blank">(CEng (UK))</a> , a Professional Engineer <a href="https://www.ecsa.co.za/default.aspx" target="_blank">(Pr Eng (SA))</a>, a member of South African Institute of Electrical Engineers <a href="https://www.saiee.org.za/" target="_blank">(SAIEE (SA))</a>, a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical & Electronic Engineers <a href="http://www.ieee.org.za/" target="_blank">(SMIEE)</a>a registered European Engineer <a href="https://www.feani.org/feani/eur-ing-title/what-eur-ing-title" target="_blank">(EUR ING (Europe))</a>, an International Professional Engineer and Fellow of the Institute of Engineering & Technology in the UK<a href="https://www.theiet.org/" target="_blank">(IntPE)</a>, and a Chartered IT Professional <a href="https://www.bcs.org/get-qualified/become-chartered/chartered-it-professional/" target="_blank">(CITP (UK)</a>.  
<br>
<br>
Adam is the co-founder of multiple startups such as <a href="https://aura.services/" target="_blank">AURA</a> a mobile security app, Tariffic a platform to best predict a customer's preferred mobile plan, <a href="https://www.resoluteeducation.com/" target="_blank">Resolute Robotics</a> an online education forum to promote engineering and robotics , and <a href="https://www.think3dots.com/" target="_blank">think3dots</a> a start-up focused on biotechnology, AI and engineering. <br><br>
Adam acted as CTO of <a href="https://vatit.com/" target="_blank">VATIT</a>, the world’s largest VAT Reclaim business (2015 - 2017). He also consulted extensively to three of South Africa's major banks, on matters at the junction of technology and business.
<br>
<br> 
His impact has been featured in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2017/09/24/are-you-ready-to-have-your-brain-connected-to-the-internet/#1a4fe307370a" target="_blank">Forbes</a>,  <a href="https://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/how-this-bioengineer-linked-a-human-brain-to-the-internet/81732/" target="_blank">Ozy</a> and <a href="https://futurism.com/researchers-have-linked-a-human-brain-to-the-internet-for-the-first-time-ever" target="_blank">Futurism</a>, together with an abundance of academic journals. His work has resulted in 4 patents as well as the media-interest piece “Brainternet”. Adam's work and projects have been re-released in hundreds of languages, making him a global phenomenon.<a href="https://twitter.com/carteblanchetv/status/1098915307073294337?lang=en" target="_blank">Carte Blanche</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B-hHUylhyyUC&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>  and many other media platforms have captured his projects, bringing spotlight to all that Adam has done for science, society and human knowledge. Other projects include an eye-controlled wheel chair, a non-cognitive 
brain transmission channel using light, a thought-controlled robotic arm with a light-invoked on/off switch, a hands-free controlled surgery interaction system, a 
CPR monitoring system, a computer-based sign language interpreter, and an eye- 
controlled cursor using the vestibulo-ocular reflex.   
<br>
<br>
Adam's own personal journey allowed for him to engineer his way around certain challenges, leading him on a most successful path. From a young age Adam has pursued the act of deconstructing technology in order to build a better and brighter future, he continues to focus on futurism, technological innovations and education throughout.
